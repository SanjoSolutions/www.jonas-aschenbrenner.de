        Jonas is one of the best programmers I&#39;ve ever worked with and has an
        intuitive understanding of technology. Not only does he produce very
        high-quality code, he also does it quickly. He is also a great and persistent
        communicator. I learned a lot from working with Jonas and would do it again in
        a heart beat.

        Jonas is one of the most talented software developers I have had the pleasure
        of working with. There are not many people who will noticeably improve the
        quality of your code but he is one of them.
