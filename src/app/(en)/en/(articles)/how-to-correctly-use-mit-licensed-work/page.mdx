<Article title="How to correctly use MIT licensed work">
  The MIT license states:

> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

“Substantial” seems to be open for interpretation. Therefore, the safest option seems to be to just always include the copyright notice and permission notice.

It makes sense that the copyright notice and the permission notice is always visible somehow when the software or documentation that uses MIT licensed work is shipped.

For web applications this information can be added on a “Credits” page that is linked somewhere in the web application (i.e. `About -> Credits` or `Credits`).

It can be done similarly in a desktop and mobile application.

An HTML template for a credits page can be found [here](https://github.com/SanjoSolutions/credits) ([demo](https://sanjosolutions.github.io/credits/)).
