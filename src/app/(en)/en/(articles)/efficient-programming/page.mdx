  ## 10-finger method

Learning and practicing the 10-finger method for writing on a keyboard can increase the writing performance over the long run. Itâ€™s highly optimized for more efficient movement (shorter distances and all fingers used). It can be practiced with [Tipp10](https://www.tipp10.com/en/).

## Snippets / Live templates

Creating and using code snippets can improve the performance of writing the code for constructs that are often used. Software development IDEs like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/using-live-templates.html) feature them.

## Machine learning assisted writing

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) can often produce correct or almost correct code for multiple lines.
