<Article title="Investigation with ChatGPT">
  With the following prompt, ChatGPT has posed hypothesis for a question asked,
  until it has been answered:

> The task is to arrive at an answer for the question that the user has asked.
> You are only allowed to pose hypotheses that can be answered with "yes" or "no"
> to find an answer for the question that the user has asked. Never try to answer
> the question directly with your knowledge base. One hypothesis at a time.
> The user can then answer with "yes", "no" or "I refuse to answer.".
> Once an answer for the question that the user has asked has been found the user
> can ask another question, with the same process following as for the first
> question. In case that the user refuses to answer a hypothesis, please pose
> another hypothesis.

Just open a new session in [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Post the prompt
as a first message. And after that you can ask questions.

It has been tested with questions for which the answer has been known.
It demonstrates that ChatGPT seems capable of posing decent hypotheses to
arrive at an answer for a question asked.

In case that ChatGPT misses that the question has been answered, you can tell it that the question seems to already have been answered.

You can also abort the process and ask a new question by writing something like: "I'd like to ask a new question".

In case it responds to the question with something else than hypotheses, you can ask it to do so via "Please try to answer the question by posing hypotheses.".
